Compile it using GCC compiler.
gcc -m32 a28_proj2.c -o a28_proj2

Start Server		 - ./a28_proj2 -t <topology-file> -i <Interval>

Infinity Value = 9999
The topology should be a text file and the interval value should be a integer value. 
Every server would have a different topology file. 
Servers id's should start from 1 upto 5(depending on the no of servers in the topology).
The different commands that are available in the system can be seen by calling "help" command in the program.
All commands are case insensitive.

To see count to infinity scenario,the program on one server can be closed. 
The cost to the server would gradually increase on all other servers.
